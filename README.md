# SEO-Project/Week 1 Challenge

The challenge was to refactor the code to meet WCAG guidelines for the purpose of search engine optimization.


## Optimizations

I first added a <header> element

I reorganized the HTML headings <h1> - <h6> and put them in proper order.

I then changed the <div> element to the <nav> element as it specifies that the content is navigation related so that users with disabilites can understand the information.

I added alt text next to the all of the image link so that the technology that exists for users with disabilites could be used. 

I organized the <ul> <li> <a href> code removing whitespace so that the code is more organized

## Lessons Learned/Challenges

Considering the fact that I started with almost no knowlege of what coding was, or how to build a website I think I did pretty well. 

I learned how to utilize the world wide web for help. There really are so many resources out there

When I was trying to fix issue with Search Engine Optimization text I couldn't get the css to adapt to the change that I made with the HTML

I learned how to commit, but I could't figure out why my messages didn't show up where I expected them to
